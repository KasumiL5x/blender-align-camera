# Blender Camera Align
> A Blender plugin to perfectly align the viewport camera to selected faces/polygons.

### What/Why?
This is a followup to [another learning project](https://github.com/KasumiL5x/blender-remote-camera) to explore Blender's addon development.

This time, however, there is a good reason!  Selecting faces and aligning the camera to be perfectly facing the average surface normal is great for camera-based UV mapping, and to orient for modeling/object placement.

## Usage
Install the Blender addon from the file `blender-align-camera.py`. Once enabled it will be available from your sidebar in a tab titled `Align Camera` nearby `Item`/`Tool`/`View`. It will only show when in **Edit** mode.

In the panel, you can press the `Align Camera` button to, well, do what it says on the tin. Make sure some faces are selected first or nothing will happen. 


## Preview
Curious but don't want to try it? Gotcha covered fam.
